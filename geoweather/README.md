# Weather Display App

This project builds on the Geolocation exercise to create a simple web page that displays the current weather at your location. It combines geolocation for GPS coordinates with data from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch and display local weather details like temperature, wind, and a weather icon.

## Overview

In this exercise:
- **Geolocation**: Retrieves the userâ€™s current latitude and longitude.
- **Weather Data**: Uses OpenWeather API to fetch weather details based on coordinates.
- **React State Management**: Stores and displays data such as temperature, wind speed and direction, weather description, and an icon representing the weather.
- **Axios for Data Fetching**: Simplifies HTTP requests to the OpenWeather API.
